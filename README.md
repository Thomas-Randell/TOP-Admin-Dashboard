# TOP-Admin-Dashboard
TheOdinProject Intermediate HTML &amp; CSS admin dashboard project

## Project Goal
The goal was to create the following layout using what I have learned in the Grid sections of The Odin Project:
![odin project admin dashboard ](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png)
## Project Output
The completed layout is shown below.
![Admin dashboard created for this exercise](/images/complete-dashboard.png)

The alignment could still be improved but for the purposes of the exercise this is considered complete.
